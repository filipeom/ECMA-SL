/*
  11.8.5 The Abstract Relational Comparison Algorithm

  The comparison x < y, where x and y are values, produces true, false, or undefined (which indicates that at
  least one operand is NaN). In addition to x and y the algorithm takes a Boolean flag named LeftFirst as a
  parameter. The flag is used to control the order in which operations with potentially visible side-effects are
  performed upon x and y. It is necessary because ECMAScript specifies left to right evaluation of expressions.
  The default value of LeftFirst is true and indicates that the x parameter corresponds to an expression that
  occurs to the left of the y parameterâ€˜s corresponding expression. If LeftFirst is false, the reverse is the case
  and operations must be performed upon y before x. Such a comparison is performed as follows:

    NOTE 1    Step 3 differs from step 7 in the algorithm for the addition operator + (11.6.1) in using and instead of or.
    NOTE 2    The comparison of Strings uses a simple lexicographic ordering on sequences of code unit values. There is no
              attempt to use the more complex, semantically oriented definitions of character or string equality and collating order
              defined in the Unicode specification. Therefore String values that are canonically equal according to the Unicode standard
              could test as unequal. In effect this algorithm assumes that both Strings are already in normalised form. Also, note that for
              strings containing supplementary characters, lexicographic ordering on sequences of UTF-16 code unit values differs from
              that on sequences of code point values.
